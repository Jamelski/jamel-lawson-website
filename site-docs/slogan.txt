Hi JameI!

Thank you for choosing Griffo!


Here are the slogans that I came up with.

Please read "Jamel Lawson" before saying each numbered slogan. It helps in the choosing process.

------
- Jamel Lawson -

1) “Designed by Iowa. Designing for you”
2) “Experience a fine design" 
3) “Open your business to the world”
4) “Developing your web to say hello”
5) “Experience a market with a global target”

Thoughts from the artist:

Having a website of your own is a very good move being a professional web developer. You will be able to showcase your portfolio and skills on that site. Your slogan should be saying hello to the world and letting your future clients understand that you can definitely better their business with your services. Your doing great man! Keep up the good pace. :)


Thanks Jamel!
